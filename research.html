            <h2>Commercial Research Groups</h2>
            <p>The Venture Research Institute (VRI) has established seven specialized Commercial Research Groups, each operating as a "Lab" focused on a key vertical. These labs are dedicated to addressing industry-specific challenges through advanced AI and decentralized compute technologies.</p>
            <p>Our labs collaborate closely with industry partners to ensure their research is grounded in real-world needs and drives commercial success. Each lab generates output in the form of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and leverages expertise for strategic Go-To-Market (GTM) placement.</p>
